plul's Public-AutoHotKey-Scripts
================================

There's only one script here that I've chosen to share at the moment. 

See this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jv2LAqkmd1c&feature=youtu.be

Basically this is an AutoHotKey script for searching websites from a small little GUI that opens on the desktop. 

It also allows you to assign hotkeys to any normal AHK command you can think of. That was the reason I created it in the first place, because I was running out of keys on my keyboard to assign hotkeys to.
It is designed to be as minimal as possible.
